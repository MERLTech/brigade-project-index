# Project Intro/Objective

The Brigade Project Index is designed to create a searchable repository of projects, current and past, create within the Code for America brigade network. We want to empower projects to find volunteers, volunteers to provide valuable contributions to projects, governments to leverage successful proejcts, brigades to foster success, and much more; through awareness of and connections to the work happening across the nation.

## MVP

The current mvp, based on the stories on github (https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade-project-index/projects/2) is based around leveraging github, a central tool for most projects in the brigade network. The MVP includes the following pieces:

* Education on github best practices, tagging, descriptions. User research will be needed to determine how native github metadata can be a source of the project info, but the team agrees that high github literacy is fundamental to a successful implementation
* A taxonomy for skills and interests to allow for standardized grouping and searching of projects. 
* A methodology (e.g. working group?) for maintaining taxonomies. 
* A defined set of metadata describing projects, potentially defined as a json file. 
* An interface that consolidates projects into a searchable list

## Project Description

### Technologies Used

* Github
* [publicode.yml](https://github.com/italia/publiccode.yml)

### Guiding Principles

* Have an open and accessible process with outreach, documentation, public discussions and transparent decisions
* Enable grassroots-driven projects across the brigade network with the minimum number of barriers (technical and otherwise) to inclusion in the index
