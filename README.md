# Project Intro/Objective
The Brigade Project Index is designed to create a searchable repository of projects, current and past, create within the Code for America brigade network. We want to empower projects to find volunteers, volunteers to provide valuable contributions to projects, governments to leverage successful proejcts, brigades to foster success, and much more; through awareness of and connections to the work happening across the nation.
