This has been done by a tedious paper-based organizational process that included school counselors nominating families and CMPD working with partners to hold toy drives, allocate toys, and make deliveries. In 2016 Code for Charlotte built a digital platform that helped organize and speed up the process, allowing CMPD to deliver Christmas to over 1,700 children.","name":"CMPD Explorers Christmas Project","status":"Drifting","topics":["CMPD","Community Outreach","charlotte","cmpd-explorers-christmas","codeforamerica","codeforcharlotte","expressjs","nodejs","react","sequelize","styled-components"]},"relationships":{"organization":{"data":{"type":"organization","id":"Open Charlotte Brigade"},"links":{"related":"/organizations/Open Charlotte Brigade.json"}}}}}
