description = "Ever curious on where the city's budget is being spent? We’ve had the good fortune to work with the City of Charlotte’s Finance department with the FY2016 data they’ve published on the City’s open data portal to start creating visualization tools to better view the City’s budget; though not in the most user-friendly format. With OPENBudget, residents, officials, and other stakeholders gain clear intel on the city of Charlotte's approved budgeting, where each dollar is going, and where it comes from. We'll spare you the trouble of looking at some grueling numbers on a screen. Individuals will be given access to the city's budget data w/ eye-popping & user-friendly visualizations. We do this to create open dialogue amongst our residents & officials in hopes of establishing a more efficient and transparent Charlotte for now and the future."
