description = "This was originally a mapping tool built in 2014 by the Philadelphia Food Policy Advisory Council (FPAC) in partnership with the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger and has since re-launched. As an unfunded project, it can use all the support it can get. Looking for collaboration to help improve its adoption, ideas to spread awareness, and potential support with lobbying the City to create a budget for it- the Mayor stated 17k people have used the tool so far in the 1,000 day report; its impact can be exponentially increased. The current site structure is not that clear, but is a good step in the right direction – and there’s a lot of resources. The next step would be to get it to wider adoption, and for this to happen we need to focus on delivering a great experience for users on their journey towards solving A) immediate food needs, B) charting a sustainable path to food security for themselves and their families, and C) connecting interested parties (like us) with advocacy tools and resources.
