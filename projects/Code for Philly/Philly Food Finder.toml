description = "We're taking Philly Food Finder over from the Mayor's Office/Hunger Coalition/FPAC as they have officially discontinued support and thus the resources may be outdated. The 2014-2018 version served to help 17k people gain greater access to food. The 2019 version, which is about to be migrated off of Google Sites and ArcGIS due to discontinued support from FPAC, has served 5k people and was very well received. Had it not been for us, the site would have served 0 in 2019 since the map stopped working and was inaccessible. Good news is, my team and I at Key Medium found a great nonprofit, the largest food bank in the area, to commit to providing an updated list of some 350 sites where people can access food, along with 50 farm markets they're at. It would be interesting to potentially tie this into #resource-philly-map in some way, along with Grounded in Philly (https://groundedinphilly.org) to further propel the community resource ecosystem we previously rebranded/launched earlier in the spring (15k people served there so far)."
